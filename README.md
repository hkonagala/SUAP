# SUAP_628
SUAP is an android application that focuses on providing a simple and intuitive solution to the parking problem at UMBC as well as 
other college campuses. SUAPâ€™s main purpose is to combine the supply and demand of parking by connecting students who are leaving campus 
with those who are coming to campus using location services in Android Programming and Firebase for back-end.
